# Abstract
# Windshield wipers play a key role during adverse weather conditions by wiping the rain continuously over the windshield area and provides a clear vision to the driver. The traditional system however requires driver's constant attention for controlling the wiping speed manually.This project is to compare this study with LEDs and infer the speed increase in it.
