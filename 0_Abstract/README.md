The windshield wiper system of passenger cars comprises three major subsystems: two wipers and their arms; a mechanism; and an electric motor. This paper presents a study on the dynamic coupling effect among these subsystems for the purpose of a better system design. Each wiper arm is modelled as a rotating cantilever beam with a lumped mass (the mass of the wiper) at its tip where a friction force is applied. The mechanism, which transmits power from the motor to the roots of the wiper arms, is treated as two connected four-bar linkages with rigid members. The electric motor drives the system with varying rotating torque and speed as its load due to the motion of arms and linkages changes with time.
