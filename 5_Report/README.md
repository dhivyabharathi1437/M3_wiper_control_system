Windshield wipers play a key role during adverse weather conditions by wiping the rain continuously over the windshield area and provides a clear vision to the driver. The traditional system however requires driver's constant attention for controlling the wiping speed manually.This project is to compare this study with LEDs and infer the speed increase in it.


The operational speed of a wiper is controlled by a wiper speed control system in accordance with frequencies. The pulse signal is digitally processed to provide a control signal. A wiper driver circuit receives the control signal and adjusts the operational speed or timing in line with it.

 The SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS are

STM32 CUBE IDE

The COMPONENTS used are

STM32F4O7VG MICROCONTROLLER BOARD

The study of Wiper control system using LEDs is done successfully.
